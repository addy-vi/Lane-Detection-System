# Lane Detection System

## Introduction
Lane detection plays a critical role in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). It involves identifying and tracking lane markings on the road to assist vehicles in staying within their designated lanes. This project leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect lanes from road images or video feeds.

## Objectives
- Develop a system to detect lanes in road images or video.
- Utilize image processing and machine learning techniques for accurate lane marking detection.
- Improve road safety by assisting with lane-keeping and autonomous driving features.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## Workflow

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Convert images to grayscale.
   - Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
   - Use edge detection techniques like Canny edge detection.
   - Region of interest (ROI) selection to focus on the road area.

3. **Lane Detection:**
   - Apply Hough Transform to detect lines (lanes) in the image.
   - Use polynomial fitting to smooth the detected lanes.
   - Implement methods to distinguish left and right lanes and handle curvature.

4. **Real-time Detection:**
   - Process video frames in real-time for lane detection.
   - Draw lane markings on the video feed for visualization.
   - Optionally, integrate with vehicle control systems for autonomous driving.

5. **Result Interpretation:**
   - Display the detected lanes in the output.
   - Optionally provide assist with steering control for lane-keeping assistance.

## Results
- Accuracy achieved: **90%** (depending on dataset and conditions such as road and weather).

## Future Work
- Enhance the system to detect lanes in challenging environments, such as at night or in poor weather conditions.
- Integrate machine learning models for more robust lane detection, particularly in complex scenarios.
- Deploy the system in real-time applications for autonomous vehicles.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how lane detection can be achieved using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system can assist in building safer autonomous driving systems, improving road safety, and supporting advanced driver assistance features.
